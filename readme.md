#Workshop 2

##Assignment #1

###Part 1

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. `git clone url_to_repository`
2. Edit the `cmua-students.txt` file and  add your name. You can just open any text editor to edit the file, if you use Word, you will automatically fail. ADD THE FILE TO COMMIT USING git add
3. Commit the changes. `git commit -m "This is your commit message"`
4. Push to the repository. (You might have to ask me for permission if you didn't add your Github username to the spreadsheet). `git push`
5. Fix any conflicts that you may came across.
6. This part is complete when everyone has added their name.

###Part 2

1. Edit the 'oedipus.txt' file and switch a line of text with another line of text. Use any text editor.
2. Do this three times. 
3. Add and then commit these changes. `git add fileX fileY`, `git commit`
4. Push these changes. `git push` (You might have to `git pull` first)
5. FIx any conflicts that you may come across
6. This part is complete when everyone has made a switch.


##Assignment #2 

1. Create an account at heroku.com and install the heroku toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
2. Fork the repository called Heroku-Demo-App to your account.
3. Change the `hello.py` to say `"Hello, World -Yours Truly, Your Name"` by modifying the string that gets returned.
4. While your command line is in this repository directory, type `heroku create`. This creates a new heroku application for your repository to go.
5. Now you are going to push to that repository. You do this by typing `git push heroku master`. `heroku` in this sense is the server we are sending it to (the word 'heroku' is an alias to an address that you can see by typing `git remote show heroku`) and the `master` part of the command is the local branch we are pushing to the remote server.


P.S. If you see any errors in this file, please fix them and push them to the repository!
